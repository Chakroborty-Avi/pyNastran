---DONE---

General GUI Behavior
====================
 - Python 3 doesn't save/reload the GUI state
 - Press OK/Cancel/Close to close window; don't use Escape

----------------------------------------------------
Half Finished
=============
- missing buttons/pulldowns for:
 - background image


#-------------------------
General GUI Behavior
====================
- legend cancel should do nothing

- right click on sidebar:
  - merge fringe/normals
  - figure out new legend menu
    - true scale
    - vector scale
  - redo animation menu
    - animate scale/phase:
      - fringe is constant (as is now)
      - icase goes away
      - replace with active fringe, displacement, and vector
    - animate time:
      - start/end time (int/float depending; slider?)
        - integer that turns into the float value
        - float value that finds closest integer value
      - frame skip (int; slider?)
      - fringe: if it's a time result; adjust the icase
      - disp:   if it's a time result; adjust the icase
      - vector: if it's a time result; adjust the icase
      
  - bold fringe, color displacement (what color?), italics vector
  - hide disp/vector based on context...meaning???

VTK bugs
========
1.  Mouse Rotation after animation
  - rotation don't work in:
  - rotation work in:

VTK features
============
1.  elemental marker plot (shell normals, shell offsets, theta)

Qt bugs
=======

- load new result:
  - menu shrinks down instead of staying as user had it

General GUI Behavior
====================
- loading a new geometry over a result doesn't overwrite the old name
- results selector window doesn't update on cycling
- QScintilla doesn't always work?
  - is this still true...I don't think so; I think it was caused by
    them splitting PyQt4 and QScintilla2
  - PySide2 doesn't have this
  - PyQt5 requires installing QScintilla2 separately

----------------------------------------------------
---DONE---
 - add explicit pulldown for formats
 - Improved Picking
   - area picking (disappears on rotation though)

---NOT DONE---
 - usm3d surface/boundary layer/incomplete volume
 - load file from * with a specific file type
 - zoom/rotate/snap hotkeys
 - unbreak hotkeys (r, x, y, z, X, Y, Z???)
 - Improved Picking
   - polygon picking
   - pick visible option
